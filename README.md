# Data Converter

An interactive C++ menu-driven program that can convert between all of the following numerical-bases: binary (base-2), octal (base-8), decimal (base-10), or hexadecimal (base-16). Interested in contributing? Refer to the [contribution guideline](https://github.com/BuiTheBoi/Data-Converter/blob/main/CONTRIBUTE.md)! (**NOTE: This repository is exclusively for CPSC 362 students only for the sole purpose of assignment 3. After this assignment is due (May 10, 2022 at 11:59 PM), I will make this repo open for ANYONE to contribute to.**)

## Set Up Guidlines

### Unix/Linux Set Up:

Before running the program, you need to install a C++ compiler on your system. To make sure that we are on the same page, I would recommend you use any Unix/Linux shell to run/test this program. To do so, you can either use any Unix/Linux OS of your choice. Or if you are a Windows user who doesn't want to switch to a completely new operating system, you can install Windows Subsystem for Linux (Which is what I use. Installation instructions: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-DHaQLrBi8).

### C++ Compiler Set Up:

Assuming you have your system set up from above, you will need to install a C++ compiler. For this particular project, we will be using the
g++ compiler.

To install g++ on Linux Shell:

```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install g++
```
